Project Description
An AI attendance system with a twist ‚Äî it marks you absent if it recognizes your face.
In this class, the only way to stay present is to stay invisible!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Students who actually attend class end up with zero attendance ‚Äî the struggle of being ‚Äútoo seen‚Äù is real.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Give attendance to students who don‚Äôt show up. Absence is now the new presence!
